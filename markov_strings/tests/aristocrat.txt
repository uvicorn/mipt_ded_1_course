My lady, I beg you, if you suck on me, do it culturally
Do not slurp, observe etiquette
(Let's go, la la la)
Bitch, I am a young aristocrat (Aristocrat)
Bitch, I have hundred carat stones on me (Expensive, fucked up)
So much money, like an Emirate (Emirate)
I'm a legend, you can die (Hey, come on)
Bitch, I'm a young aristocrat (I'm young)
Bitch, I'm wearing hundred-carat stones (And you're dumb)
So much money, like an Emirate (I'm like Dubai)
I'm a legend, you can die (Khm-khm-khm)
Bitch, I'm an aristocratic daddy
See, a moth suits me (haha)
I only need a top, you're like a little mermaid (Suck)
She's looking for a treasure on my card (Find it)
The baby is jumping, but not on a skipping rope (On what?)
I splattered her, but not in a salami (Cum)
Smeared her face with a magic wand (Oops)
Your boyfriend will wipe it off, he's a rag (Ha ha ha)
Threw ice on the plane, the HYPE will leave
A year later, for the third year now, well, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I'm like that joke: from mouth to another mouth
Your hoe is always waiting for me (Yeah, yeah)
They tell me: I did everything by deception (Fucked up)
They say: I will not become a legend (Never)
But what should I say to those fuckers? (Hmm)
My guards have guards (La la la)

Slava, what did you do?
Ha!
Hey, the chain is on me, a rash of lava
Weaving thousands on bag LV
Hundreds of bitches want to come to me
Hundreds of bitches want stones
How are you? How are you?
This is a new Cadillac
Making money, making money
Making money, fucking like that (okay, few)
Ay, bitch, we got some guns (pr-r, paw)
Paw-paw, hit the carcass (ha)
I'm wearing two pillows (oh yeah)
Bitch, I'm hanging like a young Pushkin (y)
Chains are hanging on Dad (e)
Digging the cache with a shovel (e)
Rich, like a capper (e)
How is your salary?
Hey, look at this
Two cartoons on my watch
Three on the neck, seven under the ass
I'm in my early twenties
Look, look

I am busy, I don't give a fuck about the crisis, I grew up in it (wah-wah-wah)
Who dreamed of what, then we took it to the takeaway (fuck-me)
Adlib is fresher than the whole music business (blee-blee)
This fit will kill faster than ko-ro-na-wee-rus
Sayonara "Sick" Boy
This is my house, this is my jon
This is my yard, the fucking chill zone
A young samurai with a transparent umbrella
Under heavy currency rain
(Kh-kh-kh) Fenimore Cooper
The lookbook spread
Your girlfriend is jerking off
To my sports car at the club
Hey, the chain is on me, a rash of lava
Weaving thousands on bag LV
Hundreds of bitches want to come to me
Hundreds of bitches want stones
How are you? How are you?
